# Assignment 4 : Convolutional Neural Networks

The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](A4-PS.pdf).

In this assignment, we work with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning using the deep learning framework PyTorch. We perform image classification on two datasets- Devanagari handwritten characters dataset and CIFAR10 dataset.
